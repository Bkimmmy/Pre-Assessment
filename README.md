Gait Feature Extraction Tool
This tool utilizes Python, OpenCV, and MediaPipe to preprocess video data and extract key gait-related features, including Arm Reach, Cadence, Object Detection, and Area Size. The extracted features are saved in a CSV file for further analysis or machine learning applications.

Features Extracted:
Arm Reach: Measures the distance between the shoulder and wrist using MediaPipe Pose Estimation.
Cadence: Estimates the cadence based on frame count and footfall detection.
Objects: Detects the number of moving objects in the video using background subtraction.
Area Size: Calculates the area size of the largest detected object.
Prerequisites:
Before running the tool, ensure that you have the following installed:

Python 3.x
OpenCV
MediaPipe
NumPy
Pandas
You can install the required packages by running:

bash
Copy code
pip install opencv-python mediapipe numpy pandas
Video Download Instructions:
To download the video from YouTube, first install the youtube-dl tool:

bash
Copy code
pip install youtube-dl
Then, download the video using the following command:

bash
Copy code
youtube-dl -o /path/to/save/video.mp4 'YOUTUBE_VIDEO_URL'
Replace YOUTUBE_VIDEO_URL with the actual link of the video and adjust the save path as necessary. The video will be saved in .mp4 format for processing.

Usage:
Download the video file from YouTube (as described above) or use your own video file.

Update the video path in the script:

python
Copy code
video_path = '/path/to/your/video.mp4'  # Update this with the path to your video file
Run the tool using the following command:

bash
Copy code
python Project.py
Output:
The extracted features will be saved in a CSV file named gait_features.csv in the same directory where the script is run. The CSV will contain columns for:

Frame
Arm Reach
Cadence
Objects
Area Size
Example Output:
csv
Copy code
Frame, Arm Reach, Cadence, Objects, Area Size
1, 0.0287, , 1, 2070601.0
2, 0.0455, 1.0, 0, 0.0
...

Notes:
This tool currently extracts gait features from videos with human subjects. It can be further refined for specific use cases, such as focusing on anomalous behavior.
Ensure your video file has proper lighting and visibility for accurate feature extraction.
